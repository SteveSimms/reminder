<p>The Reminder refers to the teachings and guidance revealed by Allah, primarily through the Quran, aimed at reminding humankind of their purpose, morality, and the consequences of their actions. It serves as a source of wisdom, instruction, and a warning to encourage reflection and mindfulness in one&rsquo;s faith and conduct.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of Allah as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. It is written in Arabic and consists of verses (ayahs) organized into chapters (surahs). The Quran serves as a guide for moral conduct, spirituality, and law for Muslims.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>Hadith refers to the recorded sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad. They serve as a crucial source of guidance for Muslims, second only to the Quran, covering various aspects of life, faith, and law.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the one and only God in Islam, the Creator of all things, and the Sustainer of the universe. He is described as being All-Knowing, All-Wise, Most Compassionate, and Most Merciful. Allah has no partners or equals, and all worship is directed to Him alone.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is the final messenger of Allah in Islam, known as the Apostle who conveyed the message of Islam to humanity. He is recognized for his exemplary character, his teachings which emphasize monotheism, compassion, and social justice, and for being a guide for Muslims. He is often referred to as &ldquo;Al-Mutawakkil&rdquo; (the one who depends upon Allah) and is regarded as a model for moral conduct and leadership. His birth took place in Mecca, and he began receiving revelations at the age of 40, which continued for 23 years until his passing.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>We worship Allah because He is the Creator of all things and the only deity worthy of worship. Worshiping Allah acknowledges His greatness, authority, and mercy, and it is an expression of gratitude, devotion, and submission to His will. It fosters a deep relationship with Him, guiding us to live moral and fulfilling lives.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshiping Allah involves sincere devotion, which includes acknowledging His oneness, praying regularly, giving charity, fasting during Ramadan, and following His guidance as outlined in the Quran and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. It is also about living righteously, treating others with kindness, and striving to fulfill one&rsquo;s religious duties and responsibilities.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>When we die, our souls are taken by the Angel of Death, and we return to Allah for judgment. Each individual will face resurrection, where their deeds are assessed, leading to either reward in Paradise or punishment in Hell based on their beliefs and actions during their life.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>You can remember Allah by engaging in practices such as reciting His names, performing prayers, reading the Quran, reflecting on His creations, and invoking Him in your daily life. Also, remembering His favors and maintaining gratitude can help strengthen this connection. Engaging in dhikr (remembrance of Allah) through various forms like supplication and reflection is highly encouraged.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-become-muslim">How do I become Muslim?</h1>

<p>To become Muslim, you need to embrace the belief and verbally declare the Shahada, which is the testimony of faith. The Shahada states: &ldquo;Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadur Rasulullah,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;I testify that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After declaring the Shahada, it is recommended to perform a ritual purification, such as a full ablution (ghusl), to signify your new faith. You may also start learning about the teachings of Islam, praying, and following the practices of the faith. Seeking guidance from a local Muslim community or imam can also be helpful in your journey.</p>
