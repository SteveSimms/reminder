      <div id="content"><h1 id="what-is-the-reminder">What is the Reminder?</h1>

<p>The Reminder refers to the Quran and the messages revealed to guide and remind humanity of God&rsquo;s teachings, mercy, and the importance of worship and obedience to Him. It serves as a source of guidance, a warning, and a reminder of the consequences of one&rsquo;s actions in this life and the hereafter.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of Allah (God) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel Gabriel. It serves as a guide for faith, practice, and morality, containing teachings, laws, and stories meant to instruct and inspire believers.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>Hadith refers to the recorded sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). These narrations provide guidance on various aspects of life, ethics, and religious practices in Islam. They serve as a significant source of Islamic law and moral instruction, complementing the Quran.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the sole deity in Islam, regarded as the Creator of the universe and everything within it. He is characterized by attributes such as being the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, All-Knowing, All-Wise, and the Sustainer of all. In Islam, Allah is unique and indivisible, with no partners or equals. Believers are encouraged to worship Him alone and rely on His guidance and mercy.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is regarded as the final prophet in Islam, known as the Messenger of Allah. He was born in Mecca around 570 CE and began receiving revelations from Allah at the age of 40, which continued for 23 years. These revelations form the Quran, the holy book of Islam. Muhammad is considered a model of moral and ethical behavior and is known for his teachings on monotheism, social justice, and compassion. He passed away in 632 CE in Medina.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>We worship Allah as an expression of our acknowledgment of His greatness, sovereignty, and mercy. Worship is a way to show gratitude, seek guidance, and establish a relationship with the Creator, recognizing that He is the source of all existence and sustenance. It reflects our reliance on Him and our desire for spiritual fulfillment and purpose in life.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshiping Allah involves sincere devotion and submission to Him alone. This can be expressed through prayer (Salah), recitation of the Quran, remembrance of Allah (Dhikr), performing good deeds, giving charity (Zakat), fasting during Ramadan, and following the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. It also includes living a life dedicated to fulfilling Allahâ€™s commands and maintaining good character and ethics. Worship is not limited to rituals but encompasses all aspects of life in obedience to Allah&rsquo;s guidance.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>When we die, our souls are taken by the Angel of Death, and we return to Allah for judgment. The deceased experience a phase of waiting until the Day of Resurrection, when all will be resurrected and held accountable for their deeds. There is an understanding in Islam that after death, individuals will witness their final destinations, either in Paradise or Hell, based on their actions and faith during their earthly lives.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>You can remember Allah through various practices such as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Reciting the Quran and its verses.</p></li>

<li><p>Engaging in regular prayers (Salah).</p></li>

<li><p>Making dhikr (remembrance) by reciting phrases like &ldquo;Subhanallah,&rdquo; &ldquo;Alhamdulillah,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Allahu Akbar.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Reflecting on the creation and blessings of Allah.</p></li>

<li><p>Praying for guidance and thanking Allah for His favors.</p></li>

<li><p>Remembering Him in your thoughts, actions, and daily routines.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-become-muslim">How do I become Muslim?</h1>

<p>To become Muslim, you need to declare the Shahada, the testimony of faith, which is: &ldquo;Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadur Rasoolullah,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can perform this declaration sincerely, either alone or in front of witnesses. It is recommended to learn about the basic beliefs and practices of Islam, including the five pillars:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Shahada (faith).</li>
<li>Salah (prayer).</li>
<li>Zakat (charity).</li>
<li>Sawm (fasting during Ramadan).</li>
<li>Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, if able).</li>
</ol>

<p>After declaring faith, it is helpful to connect with a local Muslim community or mosque for support and guidance.</p>
