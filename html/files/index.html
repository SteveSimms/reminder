      <div id="content"><h1 id="what-is-the-reminder">What is the Reminder?</h1>

<p>The &ldquo;Reminder&rdquo; refers to the Quran. It is described as a guide and a mercy for people, and it serves as a warning and a source of reminders for those who are mindful of Allah.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the sacred scripture of Islam, believed to be the literal word of Allah as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. It is a guide and a source of spiritual insight, delivered in Arabic, and is regarded as a clear Book whose verses are perfectly explained. It serves as a guide and a mercy for people of sure faith.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>A Hadith is a report or narration about the sayings, actions, or approvals of the Prophet Muhammad. Hadiths are an essential source of guidance for Muslims, complementing the Quran in providing insights into Islamic practices and teachings. They are collected in various books by scholars and are used for understanding the implementation of the Prophet&rsquo;s teachings in daily life.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the One and Only God, the Creator of all things, the Sustainer, and the One worthy of worship. He is the Almighty, All-Knowing, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, and possesses the Most Beautiful Names. Everything in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is the last prophet in Islam, sent by Allah as a messenger to convey His final revelation, the Quran, to humanity. He is described as a witness, a bringer of glad tidings, a warner, and a protector for the people. He is known for his exemplary character, being neither harsh nor hard-hearted, forgiving and kind even to those who wronged him. Muhammad is also referred to as &ldquo;Al-Mutawakkil,&rdquo; one who depends upon Allah. He is regarded as the &ldquo;seal of the prophets,&rdquo; indicating that no prophets will come after him.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Muslims worship Allah because He is the One true God, the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Worshiping Allah is an act of gratitude, devotion, and obedience, recognizing His supremacy, mercy, and guidance in life. The Quran emphasizes that worship is due to Allah alone, as He has no partners and nothing else is worthy of worship. It is a means to strengthen the spiritual connection and seek His pleasure and rewards in this life and the hereafter.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshipping Allah involves performing the obligatory prayers, fasting during Ramadan, giving to charity (Zakat), and performing Hajj if we are able. It also includes being sincerely devoted to Allah, associating no partners with Him, and obeying His commands. Worship can be practiced through acts of devotion, remembrance, gratitude, and living a life in accordance with Islamic teachings.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>In Islam, when we die, our soul is taken by the Angel of Death and we are returned to Allah. The Quran mentions that Allah gives life and causes death, and to Him we are returned (10:56). After death, one&rsquo;s deeds remain with them and they will be shown their place in either Paradise or Hell, which will be their destination until the Day of Resurrection (Hadith, Bukhari Volume 2, Book 23, Number 422). Eventually, everyone will be resurrected for judgment by Allah (Quran 45:26).</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>You can remember Allah by regularly engaging in prayer, reflection on His signs and blessings, reciting the Quran, and invoking His names. Pausing throughout the day to make dhikr (remembrance) such as saying &ldquo;Subhanallah&rdquo; (Glory be to Allah), &ldquo;Alhamdulillah&rdquo; (Praise be to Allah), &ldquo;Allahu Akbar&rdquo; (Allah is the Greatest), or any other forms of remembrance strengthens your connection with Allah. Engaging sincerely in these activities can help keep your heart connected to Him.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-become-muslim">How do I become Muslim?</h1>

<p>To become a Muslim, you need to declare the Shahada, which is the Islamic declaration of faith. It states: &ldquo;Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadur Rasoolallah,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.&rdquo; This declaration is sufficient for embracing Islam. It&rsquo;s also encouraged to follow Islamic practices like prayer, fasting, and engaging with the Muslim community for guidance and support.</p>
