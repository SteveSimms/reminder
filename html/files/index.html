      <div id="content"><h1 id="what-is-the-reminder">What is the Reminder?</h1>

<p>The Reminder refers to the messages and guidance revealed by Allah, primarily conveyed through the Quran. It serves as a warning and guidance for humanity, encouraging people to reflect upon their actions, remember Allah, and adhere to the teachings that lead to righteousness and faith.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the word of Allah revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. It serves as a guide for personal conduct, moral principles, and spiritual guidance, containing teachings on faith, law, and worship. The Quran is considered a literary masterpiece in Arabic and is recited in prayers and various aspects of daily life by Muslims.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>A Hadith is a recorded statement, action, or approval of the Prophet Muhammad. It serves as a source of Islamic law and moral guidance, alongside the Quran, and is used to understand and interpret various aspects of Islam.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the One and Only God, the Creator of all things. He is described as the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, the Supreme Knower of the seen and unseen, and the Sustainer of everything. Allah is unique with no partners, and all authority belongs to Him. He is known for His beautiful attributes, and believers are encouraged to worship Him alone.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is considered the final messenger of Allah in Islam. He was born in Mecca around 570 CE and is regarded as the &ldquo;Seal of the Prophets.&rdquo; He received revelations from Allah, which are compiled in the Quran. Known for his exemplary character, he preached monotheism and ethical conduct, establishing the foundations of Islam. His life and teachings have a profound influence on over a billion Muslims worldwide.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>We worship Allah to acknowledge His greatness, express gratitude for His blessings, seek guidance, and fulfill our purpose as created beings. Worship helps cultivate a relationship with Him, aligning our lives with His will and attaining spiritual fulfillment.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshiping Allah involves sincere devotion, obedience, and various acts of worship, including prayer (Salah), fasting (Sawm), giving alms (Zakat), and performing good deeds. It is essential to worship Allah alone, without associating partners with Him, and to maintain a heartfelt connection through remembrance and gratitude. Observing the teachings of the Quran and the example of the Prophet Muhammad also guides worship practices.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>When we die, our souls are taken by the Angel of Death, and we face a transition to the afterlife. After death, we are believed to be resurrected for judgment, where our deeds are evaluated, resulting in either paradise or punishment. The process includes experiences in the grave and a final resurrection on the Day of Judgment. Ultimately, every soul will return to Allah for judgment based on their actions in life.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>You can remember Allah by engaging in regular prayers, reciting Quranic verses, making supplications (duas), and reflecting on His attributes and creations. Engaging in meditation on His favours, being mindful in your daily activities, and dedicating moments of your day to remembrance (dhikr) also help. It&rsquo;s important to keep a sincere heart and be consistent in your efforts.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-become-muslim">How do I become Muslim?</h1>

<p>To become Muslim, you need to sincerely declare the Shahada, which is the testimony of faith. This involves saying, &ldquo;Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, wa Ashhadu anna Muhammadur rasoolullah,&rdquo; which translates to, &ldquo;I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger.&rdquo; It is also recommended to perform a ritual purification (ghusl) and start learning about the teachings and practices of Islam, including prayer, fasting, and charity. Consider seeking guidance from a local Muslim community or an imam for support.</p>
