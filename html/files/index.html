<p>The Reminder refers to the messages and revelations from Allah, particularly the Quran, which serve as guidance, warnings, and lessons for humanity to reflect upon and adhere to in order to live a righteous life. It emphasizes remembrance of Allah, moral conduct, and awareness of the consequences of one&rsquo;s actions.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of Allah as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. It serves as a guide for personal conduct, worship, and law, and is regarded as a source of spiritual wisdom and knowledge. The Quran is written in Arabic and consists of various chapters (Surahs) that address a range of topics and issues relevant to faith and life.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>A Hadith is a recorded saying, action, or approval of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It serves as a source of guidance for Muslims, along with the Quran, on matters of faith, law, and morality. Each Hadith often has a chain of narrators that verifies its authenticity.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the one true God in Islam, the Creator of all things. He is all-knowing, all-powerful, and merciful. Allah is described as the Sustainer and Maintainer of the universe, with no partners or rivals, and is worthy of worship alone.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is the last messenger of Allah in Islam, known as the Prophet who conveyed the final revelation, the Quran. He was born in Mecca around 570 CE and is revered for his teachings and exemplary character. Muhammad is considered both a prophet and a messenger, playing a crucial role in the spread of Islam and guiding humanity towards the worship of one God. His life and teachings are documented in the Hadith literature, which complement the Quran.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>We worship Allah because He is the Creator and Sustainer of everything, deserving of our gratitude and devotion. Worship is a way to express our love, reverence, and obedience to Him, recognizing His mercy, wisdom, and power. It helps us cultivate a connection with Him, guiding us in our lives and actions.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshiping Allah involves sincere devotion, which includes prayer, supplication, gratitude, and following His commandments. Key acts of worship include:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Prayer (Salah)</strong>: Performing the five daily prayers.</li>
<li><strong>Recitation of the Quran</strong>: Reading and reflecting on the Quran.</li>
<li><strong>Zakat</strong>: Giving charity to those in need.</li>
<li><strong>Fasting</strong>: Observing the fast during the month of Ramadan.</li>
<li><strong>Invocation (Dua)</strong>: Making personal supplications and prayers.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging His oneness</strong>: Believing in and proclaiming that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.</li>
</ol>

<p>Worship is expressed through both actions and intentions, aiming to please Allah in all aspects of life.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>When we die, our souls are taken by the Angel of Death. We enter a different state of existence where we will eventually be resurrected on the Day of Judgment. Our deeds and actions during life will be reviewed, determining our fate in the Hereafter, either in Paradise or Hell.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>You can remember Allah by engaging in regular prayer, reciting the Quran, making dhikr (remembrance) through phrases like &ldquo;Subhanallah&rdquo; (Glory be to Allah), &ldquo;Alhamdulillah&rdquo; (Praise be to Allah), and &ldquo;Allahu Akbar&rdquo; (Allah is the Greatest). Reflect on His creations, express gratitude, and maintain mindfulness of His presence in your daily life. Frequent invocation and gratitude help strengthen your connection with Allah.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-become-muslim">How do I become Muslim?</h1>

<p>To become a Muslim, one must sincerely declare the Shahada, which is the testimony of faith. This involves saying, &ldquo;Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadur Rasulullah,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger.&rdquo; It is also important to understand the basic teachings of Islam, perform the five daily prayers, observe fasting during Ramadan, give Zakat (almsgiving), and strive to live according to the principles of Islam. It is recommended to seek guidance from knowledgeable Muslims or local Islamic centers.</p>
