      <div id="content"><h1 id="what-is-the-reminder">What is the Reminder?</h1>

<p>The Reminder refers to the Quran, which is a guidance and a message for humanity. It serves as a divine revelation preserved by Allah, providing guidance, wisdom, and warnings to all people.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of Allah delivered to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. It serves as a guide and mercy for those with sure faith, offering insights, reminders, and clear revelations in Arabic. The Quran is considered a confirmation of previous scriptures and is preserved in its original form. It is a source of spiritual and legal guidance for Muslims.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>A Hadith is a narration or a report detailing the sayings, actions, or approvals of the Prophet Muhammad. It serves as a significant source of Islamic teachings and law, second only to the Quran.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the one true God in Islam, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. He is the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, All-Knowing, and All-Wise. Everything in creation glorifies Him, and He is the Sustainer and Maintainer of all things. There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, and all creatures will return to Him.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is considered the last prophet in Islam, sent by Allah to guide humanity. He is regarded as the &ldquo;Messenger of Allah&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Seal of the Prophets.&rdquo; Muhammad was born in Mecca and received divine revelations from Allah, which are recorded in the Quran, the holy book of Islam. Muslims believe he was sent as a witness, a bringer of glad tidings, and a warner. Prophet Muhammad is highly respected for his character, teachings, and as a mercy to the worlds.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>We worship Allah because He is the Creator and Sustainer of all things, and the only One worthy of worship. Worshipping Allah is a fundamental aspect of Islamic faith, emphasizing our devotion, gratitude, and obedience to Him. It helps us maintain a strong spiritual connection, seek guidance, and fulfill the purpose of our existence.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshipping Allah involves believing in Him and associating nothing with Him. It includes performing acts such as offering prayers, showing gratitude, establishing prayer, giving charity, fasting, and performing good deeds sincerely for His sake. Worship also means following Allah&rsquo;s commands, maintaining sincerity and devotion in all actions dedicated to Him, and fulfilling the rights and responsibilities He has prescribed.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>According to Islamic teachings, when a person dies, their soul is taken by angels and they experience the state of barzakh, an intermediary stage until the Day of Judgment. On that day, all people will be resurrected and judged by Allah based on their deeds. Those who were righteous will be awarded Paradise, while those who did evil will face punishment in Hell.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>To remember Allah, you can:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Engage in regular prayer (Salat) and establish it as a routine.</p></li>

<li><p>Recite and reflect on the Quran frequently.</p></li>

<li><p>Engage in Dhikr, which involves repeating praises and supplications.</p></li>

<li><p>Remember Allah&rsquo;s blessings and express gratitude.</p></li>

<li><p>Maintain mindfulness of Allah in daily actions and decisions.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-become-muslim">How do I become Muslim?</h1>

<p>To become a Muslim, you need to sincerely proclaim the Shahada, which is the testimony of faith. The Shahada is: &ldquo;Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadur rasulullah.&rdquo; This means, &ldquo;I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.&rdquo; It is important to say this with sincere belief and understanding. Embracing Islam also involves accepting its core beliefs and practices, such as belief in one God, the prophets, and the Quran, and committing to follow the principles of Islam in your life.</p></li>
