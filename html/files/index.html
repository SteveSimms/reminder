      <div id="content"><h1 id="what-is-the-reminder">What is the Reminder?</h1>

<p>The Reminder generally refers to the Quran, which is the revelation from Allah to guide humankind. It serves as a reminder to believers, a guide, and a mercy for all people.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy scripture of Islam, regarded as the literal word of Allah as revealed to Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. It is a guide and mercy for those of faith, delivered in Arabic and known for its clear and perfectly explained verses.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>A Hadith refers to a narration or report of the sayings, actions, or approvals of the Prophet Muhammad. Hadiths are second in authority to the Quran for Muslims and serve as a source of Islamic law and moral guidance. They are collected in various Hadith books, such as those compiled by Bukhari and Muslim.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the One and Only God, the Creator of all things. There is no god worthy of worship except Him. He is the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, the King, the Almighty, the All-Wise, and possessor of the Most Beautiful Names. Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, and He is praised in this life and the next. Allah alone is the Sustainer and Maintainer of everything.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is regarded as the final prophet in Islam. He is the messenger of Allah who conveyed the Qur&rsquo;an, the sacred scripture of Islam, and established the faith&rsquo;s teachings. Known for his character and leadership, he is considered a model for Muslims to follow. He is often referred to as &ldquo;Al-Mutawakkil&rdquo; (the one who depends upon Allah) and has multiple names with special meanings. Muhammad is seen as the &ldquo;seal of the prophets,&rdquo; meaning no prophet will follow him.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>We worship Allah because He is the sole Creator and Sustainer of the universe, and worship is an expression of devotion, gratitude, and submission to His will. Worshipping Allah acknowledges His authority and seeks His guidance and mercy. It is also a means to cultivate mindfulness and fulfill the purpose of our existence, as many verses emphasize that worship is due to Allah alone.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>To worship Allah, Muslims engage in acts of devotion and obedience, such as performing the five daily prayers, reciting the Quran, giving charity, fasting during Ramadan, and making pilgrimage to Mecca if able. Worship also includes being sincere in intentions and actions, being grateful, and leading a life that reflects Islamic teachings by showing kindness, honesty, and justice. It is to worship Allah alone with sincerity and devotion.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>According to Islamic teachings, when a person dies, their soul is taken by the Angel of Death. The body is buried, and in the grave, the deceased will be questioned by angels about their faith. The soul then experiences either comfort or punishment in the grave, known as the life of the Barzakh. This remains until the Day of Resurrection (Judgment Day), when everyone will be resurrected for final judgment by Allah. Those who believed and did good deeds will be rewarded with Paradise, while those who disbelieved or did evil will face punishment.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>To remember Allah, engage in regular prayer (Salah), recite and reflect on the Quran, offer supplications (Dua), and engage in Dhikr (repetition of praises and names of Allah). Additionally, being mindful of Allah in daily actions and expressing gratitude for His blessings are key aspects.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-become-muslim">How do I become Muslim?</h1>

<p>To become a Muslim, you must declare the <strong>Shahada</strong>, the Islamic declaration of faith, with sincerity and belief. The Shahada states: &ldquo;Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadur rasulullah&rdquo; which means &ldquo;I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.&rdquo; This declaration affirms your belief in the oneness of Allah and the prophethood of Muhammad.</p>
