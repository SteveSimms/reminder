      <h1 id="what-is-the-reminder">What is the Reminder?</h1>

<p>The Reminder refers to the messages and revelations from Allah, particularly the Quran, which serve as guidance, warnings, and teachings for humanity. It encourages reflection, mindfulness, and remembrance of Allah&rsquo;s signs and commands.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of Allah (God) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. It serves as a guide for Muslims in matters of faith, morality, and law, and is written in Arabic. The Quran consists of verses (ayahs) organized into chapters (surahs). It is regarded as a source of spiritual guidance and wisdom for believers.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>A Hadith is a recorded saying, action, or tacit approval of the Prophet Muhammad. It serves as a source of guidance for Muslims, complementing the teachings of the Quran. Hadiths are critical in shaping Islamic law, ethics, and practices.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the One true God, the Creator of all things, characterized as the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful. He is All-Knowing and All-Wise, and there is no god worthy of worship except Him. He sustains and maintains everything in existence and encompasses all knowledge of the seen and unseen.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is the last messenger of Allah in Islam, regarded as a model for human behavior and the final prophet in a line that includes figures like Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He was born in Mecca around 570 CE and received revelations from Allah through the angel Gabriel. These revelations are recorded in the Quran, the holy book of Islam. Muhammad is known for his exemplary character, teachings on compassion, justice, and monotheism, and his role in establishing the Muslim community.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>We worship Allah because He is the Creator, Sustainer, and Lord of the universe, deserving of our devotion and gratitude. Worshiping Allah fulfills our purpose as humans, strengthens our connection with Him, and cultivates a sense of moral and spiritual guidance in life. It is an expression of our acknowledgment of His greatness, mercy, and authority.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshiping Allah involves several key practices:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Sincerity in Devotion</strong>: Being sincerely devoted to Allah alone, without associating any partners with Him.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Prayer</strong>: Performing the five daily prayers (Salah) as prescribed.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Supplication</strong>: Engaging in personal prayers and invocations (dua) to seek Allah&rsquo;s guidance and mercy.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Gratitude</strong>: Expressing gratitude for Allah&rsquo;s blessings and provisions.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Reading and Reflecting on the Quran</strong>: Understanding and following the teachings of the Quran.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>These actions, grounded in faith, help deepen one&rsquo;s connection with Allah.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>When we die, our souls are taken by the Angel of Death, and we are returned to Allah for judgment. The deceased will either be shown their place in Paradise or Hell, indicating their ultimate fate. On the Day of Resurrection, all will be raised back to life for final judgment based on their deeds.</p>
