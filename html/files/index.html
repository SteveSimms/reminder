<p>The Reminder refers to the Quran and the messages it conveys, serving as guidance and a warning for humanity. It emphasizes reflections on faith, moral conduct, and remembrance of Allah&rsquo;s signs and teachings.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of Allah (God) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. It serves as a guide for Muslims, containing teachings on faith, morality, worship, and law. The Quran is written in Arabic and consists of chapters (Surahs) and verses (Ayahs). It is regarded as a source of guidance, wisdom, and a reminder for humanity.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>A Hadith is a recorded saying, action, or approval of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It serves as a source of guidance for Muslims, complementing the teachings of the Quran. Each Hadith is typically accompanied by a chain of narrators (Isnad) that verifies its authenticity.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the one and only God in Islam, the Creator of all things, and the Sustainer of the universe. He is described as the All-Knowing, All-Wise, Most Compassionate, and Most Merciful. Allah is the source of guidance, and worship is directed solely to Him.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is regarded as the last messenger of Allah in Islam. He was born in Mecca around 570 CE and received divine revelations that constitute the Quran, the holy book of Islam. He is known for his role in spreading the message of monotheism and establishing the foundations of Islamic teachings and practices. He is also referred to as Al-Mutawakkil, the Apostle, and has several other titles that signify his significance in guiding humanity.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>We worship Allah because He is the Creator of all things, deserving of our devotion and gratitude. Worshipping Him acknowledges His sovereignty, power, and mercy, fostering a relationship of reverence, obedience, and thankfulness. It is through worship that we seek guidance, strength, and forgiveness, ultimately fulfilling our purpose as His creation.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshiping Allah involves sincere devotion, which can include prayer, reading the Quran, performing acts of charity, fasting, and following His guidance as outlined in Islamic teachings. It also means recognizing His oneness, avoiding associations with Him, and living a life that reflects gratitude and obedience to His commandments. Regular prayers, acts of kindness, and mindfulness of His presence in daily life are also essential aspects of worship.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>When we die, our souls are taken by the Angel of Death, and we are returned to Allah for judgment. The body is buried, and our deeds remain with us. After death, we will experience a kind of awareness regarding our place in the Hereafter, either in Paradise or Hell, based on our actions in this life. On the Day of Resurrection, we will be resurrected for final judgment.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>You can remember Allah by engaging in regular prayers, reciting the Quran, reflecting on His creation, and practicing gratitude for His blessings. Additionally, you can invoke His names, engage in dhikr (remembrance of Allah), and be mindful of His presence in your daily life.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-become-muslim">How do I become Muslim?</h1>

<p>To become a Muslim, you need to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Shahada</strong>: Recite the declaration of faith, known as the Shahada, which states: &ldquo;Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadur rasulullah.&rdquo; (I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Intention</strong>: Have a sincere intention in your heart to embrace Islam and worship only Allah.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Knowledge</strong>: Learn about the fundamental beliefs and practices of Islam, including the Five Pillars: belief in one God (Allah), prayer (Salah), giving alms (Zakat), fasting during Ramadan, and pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj) if able.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Community</strong>: It can be beneficial to join a local mosque or community of Muslims to seek guidance, support, and further understanding of the faith.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Practice</strong>: Start practicing Islam by performing the five daily prayers and living according to Islamic values and teachings.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have taken these steps, you are considered a Muslim.</p>
