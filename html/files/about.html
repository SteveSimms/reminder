      <h1 id="what-is-the-reminder">What is the Reminder?</h1>

<p>The Reminder refers to the revelations and guidance from Allah, particularly the Quran. It serves as a reminder for humanity about the truth, morality, and the need to worship and obey Allah. It is intended to benefit believers and guide them towards a life of righteousness and awareness of their responsibilities.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of Allah (God) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. It serves as a guide for Muslims, encompassing teachings on faith, morality, and law, and is written in Arabic. The Quran is regarded as a final and unaltered revelation, intended for all of humanity.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>Hadith refers to the recorded sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). These narrations are considered a significant source of guidance for Muslims, alongside the Quran, and cover various aspects of life, jurisprudence, ethics, and spirituality.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the one and only God in Islam, the Creator, Sustainer, and Maintainer of all things. He is described as the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful, the All-Knowing, and the Almighty. All praise belongs to Him, and He is the Supreme Judge who encompasses the heavens and the earth.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is considered the last prophet in Islam, sent by Allah to guide humanity with the message of monotheism and righteousness. He is revered as the &ldquo;Seal of the Prophets,&rdquo; meaning no prophets will come after him. Born in Mecca in 570 CE, he received divine revelations, which are compiled in the Quran. He is known for his exemplary character, leadership, and compassion, and is highly regarded by Muslims around the world.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>We worship Allah to acknowledge His greatness, express gratitude for His blessings, seek guidance, and fulfill our purpose as created beings. Worship is a way to connect with Allah, show submission to His will, and attain spiritual fulfillment and peace.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshiping Allah involves sincerely believing in Him, obeying His commands, performing the five daily prayers, paying alms (Zakat), fasting during Ramadan, and engaging in acts of kindness and gratitude. It includes recognizing Him as the only deity worthy of worship and avoiding any form of polytheism. Engaging in personal prayers, seeking repentance, and striving to follow His guidance in daily life are essential aspects of worship.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>When we die, our souls are taken by the Angel of Death, and we will ultimately be returned to Allah for judgment. The state of our souls after death varies; believers may experience peace, while the unrepentant face consequences for their actions. After a period in the grave, everyone will be resurrected for the Day of Judgment, where each individual&rsquo;s deeds will be assessed.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>You can remember Allah by engaging in regular prayers, reciting the Quran, and making dhikr (remembrance) by saying phrases such as &ldquo;Subhanallah&rdquo; (Glory be to Allah), &ldquo;Alhamdulillah&rdquo; (All praise is due to Allah), and &ldquo;Allahu Akbar&rdquo; (Allah is the Greatest). Additionally, reflect on Allah&rsquo;s creations, express gratitude for His blessings, and maintain mindfulness of His presence in your daily life.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-become-muslim">How do I become Muslim?</h1>

<p>To become a Muslim, one must declare the Shahada, which is the testimony of faith: &ldquo;Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadur rasulullah,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger.&rdquo; This declaration signifies your acceptance of the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad.</p>

<p>After the Shahada, it is recommended to perform the five daily prayers, observe fasting during Ramadan, give Zakat (charity), and strive to follow the teachings of Islam. It can also be helpful to learn more about the faith and engage with a local Muslim community for support.</p>
