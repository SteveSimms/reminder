      <h1 id="what-is-the-reminder">What is the Reminder?</h1>

<p>The Reminder refers to the Quran and its teachings, serving as guidance, a warning, and a source of reflection for humanity. It emphasizes the importance of being mindful of Allah&rsquo;s revelations and acts as a reminder for those with faith.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of God (Allah) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. It serves as a guide for life, covering various aspects of faith, morality, and guidance for personal conduct and social justice. The Quran is written in Arabic and consists of 114 chapters (surahs) that vary in length. It is regarded as the most important text in Islam and is recited in prayers and rituals.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>A Hadith is a recorded saying, action, or approval of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It serves as a source of guidance for Muslims, detailing aspects of faith, law, and ethics. Each Hadith typically includes a chain of narrators (isnad) and the text (matn) of the narration.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the one and only God in Islam, the Creator of all things, and the Sustainer of the universe. He is described as All-Knowing, All-Wise, Most Compassionate, and Most Merciful. Allah has no partners, offspring, or equals, and all authority belongs to Him.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is regarded in Islam as the final messenger of Allah (God), sent to guide humanity. He is known as a witness, a giver of glad tidings, and a warning to those who disbelieve. Born in Mecca around 570 CE, he received revelations from Allah through the angel Gabriel, which form the Quran. Muhammad is respected for his character, leadership, and the establishment of Islamic teachings, emphasizing kindness, forgiveness, and a strong moral framework. He is seen as a role model for Muslims, who aim to follow his practices and teachings.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>We worship Allah as an expression of our submission and devotion to Him, recognizing Him as the sole Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Worshiping Allah fosters a relationship built on gratitude, love, and awe, as He is deserving of our reverence for His mercy, wisdom, and authority. Worshiping Him also provides guidance, purpose, and fulfillment in life.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshiping Allah involves sincere devotion, which includes performing the five daily prayers (Salah), reciting the Quran, giving charity (Zakat), fasting during Ramadan, and living a life aligned with Islamic teachings. It also entails recognizing Allah&rsquo;s oneness, showing gratitude, and being kind to others. Ultimately, worship is an act of submission and acknowledgment of Allah&rsquo;s sovereignty and greatness.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>When we die, our souls are taken by the Angel of Death, and we transition from this life to the next. After death, we will be judged for our deeds and either rewarded with paradise or punished in hell. The process of resurrection will occur on the Day of Judgment, where all individuals will be brought back to life for final accountability.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>To remember Allah, you can engage in regular prayers (Salah), recite the Quran, make dhikr (remembrance of Allah) through phrases like &ldquo;Subhanallah&rdquo; (Glory be to Allah), &ldquo;Alhamdulillah&rdquo; (All praise is for Allah), and &ldquo;Allahu Akbar&rdquo; (Allah is the Greatest). Reflect on His creations, express gratitude for His blessings, and seek knowledge about Him through study and contemplation.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-become-muslim">How do I become Muslim?</h1>

<p>To become a Muslim, you need to sincerely declare the Shahada, which is the testimony of faith. This involves saying, &ldquo;Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadur rasulullah,&rdquo; meaning, &ldquo;I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After declaring the Shahada, it is recommended to learn and practice the basic tenets of Islam, such as performing the five daily prayers, fasting during Ramadan, paying zakat (charity), and studying the Quran. It is also helpful to connect with a local Muslim community for support and guidance.</p>
