      <h1 id="what-is-the-reminder">What is the Reminder?</h1>

<p>The Reminder refers to the Quran, which serves as a guidance and a message for humanity, urging reflection, remembrance of Allah, and adherence to His teachings. It emphasizes the importance of being mindful of one&rsquo;s actions and the consequences that follow.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of Allah (God) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. It is written in Arabic and serves as a guide for Muslims in matters of faith, morality, and guidance for personal conduct. The Quran is regarded as a comprehensive and final revelation, encompassing various teachings and laws for humanity.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>A Hadith is a recorded narration of the words, actions, or approvals of the Prophet Muhammad. It serves as a source of guidance in Islamic teachings, alongside the Quran. Hadiths cover various aspects of life, law, and morality, providing context and explanation for Muslim practices and beliefs.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah-to-us">Who is Allah to us?</h1>

<p>Allah is the Creator of all things, the Sustainer, the Most Compassionate and Most Merciful. He is the King, the Most Holy, the All-Perfect, and the source of guidance and authority. Allah knows all and is just in judgment, deserving of worship and devotion from all of humanity.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is the last messenger of Allah in Islam, known as the &ldquo;Seal of the Prophets.&rdquo; He was born in Mecca around 570 CE and began receiving revelations from Allah at the age of 40, which were later compiled into the Quran. Muhammad is regarded as a model for Muslims, embodying the teachings of Islam through his actions and sayings (Hadith). He preached monotheism and guided his followers in faith, morality, and community life until his death in 632 CE.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshiping Allah involves sincere devotion and obedience to Him, which includes actions such as performing the five daily prayers, reciting the Quran, giving charity (Zakat), fasting during Ramadan, and showing kindness to others. It also involves recognizing His uniqueness, thanking Him for His blessings, and striving to follow His guidance in daily life. Ultimately, worship is about dedicating oneself to Allah with sincerity and humility.</p>

<h1 id="where-did-we-come-from">Where did we come from?</h1>

<p>According to Islamic belief, humanity was created by Allah from dust, then developed from a sperm-drop, eventually forming into a clinging clot and a lump of flesh. Allah created us in stages as part of His divine purpose.</p>

<h1 id="where-do-we-go-when-we-die">Where do we go when we die?</h1>

<p>In Islamic belief, when a person dies, their soul is taken by the Angel of Death and they are transitioned to the afterlife. After death, individuals are shown their potential place in the Hereafter, either in Paradise or in Hell. Ultimately, all souls will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment for accountability before Allah, after which they will be rewarded or punished based on their deeds in this life.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>You can remember Allah by engaging in regular acts of worship, such as prayer, recitation of the Quran, and invoking Allah&rsquo;s names. Additionally, reflecting on His creation and blessings, expressing gratitude, and being mindful in daily activities can help strengthen your remembrance of Him. It is encouraged to remember Him often, both in solitude and in community.</p>

<h1 id="none-of-this-makes-sense-to-me">None of this makes sense to me</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s okay to feel that way. Understanding complex topics can take time and reflection. If you have specific questions or areas you&rsquo;re struggling with, I&rsquo;d be happy to help clarify or provide more information.</p>
