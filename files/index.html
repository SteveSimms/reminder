      <h1 id="what-is-the-reminder">What is the Reminder?</h1>

<p>The Reminder refers to the Quran and the messages conveyed by the prophets, serving as guidance, warnings, and a source of reflection for humanity. It emphasizes the importance of being mindful of one&rsquo;s actions, remembering Allah, and adhering to His teachings.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-quran">What is the Quran?</h1>

<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of Allah (God) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. It serves as a guide for moral and spiritual conduct, containing teachings, laws, and narratives that address various aspects of life. The Quran is written in Arabic and is composed of verses (ayahs) grouped into chapters (surahs). It is regarded as a comprehensive source of guidance for Muslims.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-hadith">What is the Hadith?</h1>

<p>A Hadith is a recorded saying, action, or approval of the Prophet Muhammad. It serves as a source of guidance for Muslims alongside the Qur&rsquo;an, detailing aspects of belief, practice, and law within Islam.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the one true God in Islam, known as the Creator of all things, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful, and the Supreme in Might. He is the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining, and has the Most Beautiful Names. Allah is deeply revered and worshipped by Muslims, who believe that all authority belongs to Him and that He is the final judge of all.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is the last messenger of Allah in Islam, known as the Apostle who conveyed Allah&rsquo;s message to humanity through the Quran. He was born in Mecca and is recognized for his exemplary character, leadership, and role as a guide for Muslims. His teachings emphasize worshiping one God, compassion, and moral integrity. He is also referred to by several names, including Muhammad and Ahmad.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-we-worship-allah">Why do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>We worship Allah because He is the Creator of all things, and it is a fundamental aspect of our faith to acknowledge His greatness and authority. Worshipping Allah brings us closer to Him, helps cultivate gratitude, and guides us in leading a righteous life. It is also a way to show our submission and devotion, fulfilling our purpose as His created beings.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we &lsquo;worship&rsquo; Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshiping Allah involves sincerity and devotion to Him alone, which can include practices like prayer, supplication, recitation of the Quran, and performing good deeds. It also means following His guidance, being mindful of His presence, and expressing gratitude for His blessings.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-when-we-die">What happens when we die?</h1>

<p>When we die, our souls are taken by the Angel of Death and we will eventually be resurrected on the Day of Judgment. Our deeds will be evaluated, and we will be held accountable for our actions during our lifetime. Those who are righteous will be rewarded, while those who have rejected faith may face punishment. The process involves an interim period where the deceased are aware of their fate based on their deeds.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>You can remember Allah by engaging in regular prayers, reciting Quranic verses, reflecting on His signs in nature, making supplications (duas), and devoting moments of your day to gratitude and contemplation of His attributes. Engaging in acts of kindness and seeking knowledge about Him also enhances your remembrance.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-become-muslim">How do I become Muslim?</h1>

<p>To become Muslim, you need to sincerely declare your faith by saying the Shahada, which is the declaration of faith in Islam. This involves affirming that &ldquo;There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.&rdquo; It is also recommended to perform a ritual purification (Ghusl) and to start practicing the core principles of Islam, including the five daily prayers, fasting during Ramadan, giving to charity (Zakat), and following the teachings of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad. Seeking guidance from a local mosque or Muslim community can also be helpful.</p>
