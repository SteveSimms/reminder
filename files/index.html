      <h1 id="what-is-the-reminder">What is the reminder?</h1>

<p>The reminder refers to the Quran, which provides guidance, warnings, and teachings from Allah to humanity. It serves as a source of reflection, inspiration, and a reminder of divine teachings and mercy.</p>

<h1 id="why-are-we-here">Why are we here?</h1>

<p>In Islam, we are here to worship Allah and fulfill our purpose in life, which involves obeying His commands and striving for righteousness. Life is also viewed as a test, where our actions and choices determine our fate in the Hereafter.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-our-purpose">What is our purpose?</h1>

<p>Our purpose is to worship and serve Allah, as indicated in various verses of the Quran. For instance, it is mentioned that humans were created for a purpose, and we are here to fulfill our responsibilities and be mindful of our Creator. Additionally, life is seen as a test for which we will be held accountable.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-worship-allah">How do we worship Allah?</h1>

<p>Worshiping Allah involves several key practices:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Belief in Oneness</strong>: Acknowledge that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.</li>
<li><strong>Prayer (Salah)</strong>: Establish regular prayers as prescribed in Islam, which include the five daily prayers.</li>
<li><strong>Sincerity</strong>: Be sincere in devotion and worship Allah alone without associating any partners with Him.</li>
<li><strong>Acts of Kindness</strong>: Engage in good deeds, show kindness to others, including family, the poor, and neighbors.</li>
<li><strong>Obedience to Commands</strong>: Follow the teachings of the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad in daily life.</li>
<li><strong>Remembrance (Dhikr)</strong>: Regularly remember and glorify Allah through phrases and supplications.</li>
<li><strong>Gratitude</strong>: Express gratitude to Allah for His blessings and seek forgiveness for shortcomings.</li>
</ol>

<p>These practices create a strong connection between the believer and Allah, fostering a spiritual and moral life.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-allah">Who is Allah?</h1>

<p>Allah is the one true God in Islam, the Creator of all things, and the Sustainer of the universe. He is described as the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, and is recognized as All-Knowing and All-Wise. Muslims believe there is no god worthy of worship except Him, and He possesses the most beautiful names and attributes.</p>

<h1 id="who-is-the-prophet-muhammad">Who is the prophet Muhammad?</h1>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is considered the last messenger of Allah in Islam. He was born in Mecca around 570 CE and is regarded as a model for conduct and morality for Muslims. He received divine revelations from Allah over a period of approximately 23 years, which are compiled in the Quran. His teachings emphasize the oneness of God, moral integrity, social justice, and compassion. Muhammad is also known for his exemplary character, kindness, and the propagation of Islam through both preaching and his actions. He passed away in 632 CE in Medina.</p>

<h1 id="where-did-we-come-from">Where did we come from?</h1>

<p>According to Islamic teachings, humans were created by Allah from dust and a sperm-drop, developing through various stages in the womb. This process emphasizes the divine power of creation.</p>

<h1 id="where-do-we-go-when-we-die">Where do we go when we die?</h1>

<p>In Islam, when a person dies, they transition to the afterlife. Their soul is taken by the Angel of Death and they are shown their place in the Hereafter, which can be either Paradise or Hell. The final judgment occurs on the Day of Resurrection when all souls are resurrected and held accountable for their deeds in this world. Those who lived righteously will be rewarded with Paradise, while those who rejected faith and committed evils may face punishment in Hell.</p>

<h1 id="how-will-the-world-end">How will the world end?</h1>

<p>The world will end with significant and catastrophic events, often referred to as the Day of Judgment or the Last Day. This includes cosmic upheavals, earthquakes, the blowing of the Trumpet, and the resurrection of all beings to stand before Allah for judgment. The earth will be transformed, and every soul will face their deeds. The righteous will be rewarded with Paradise, while the wicked will face punishment in Hell. These events are described in various verses of the Quran and Hadiths.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-remember-allah">How do I remember Allah?</h1>

<p>You can remember Allah by engaging in regular prayers, reciting the Quran, making supplications (dua), contemplating His creation, and reflecting on His attributes. Additionally, reflecting on His blessings and expressing gratitude can enhance your remembrance of Him. Remembering Allah morning and evening, and engaging in acts of worship throughout the day, are also encouraged.</p>
